# Hi there! I'm Chit Chit (aka Little Squid)👋🦑 

## About Me

- I'm a recent computer science graduate exploring the exciting world of tech.
- Cybersecurity is my passion — I love the challenge of problem-solving in this ever-evolving field (mostly because I enjoy feeling slightly less clueless than yesterday 😝).
- I also love designing websites, especially cute and aesthetic ones. Why choose between secure and stylish when you can have both?

## My Interests

Outside of coding, you'll find me:
- Immersed in graphic novels 📖
- Tackling CTF challenges 🚩
- Listening to music (any recommendations are welcome!) 🎧🎼
- Playing boardgames (co-op, non co-op, I play everything) ♟️🎲

## Fun Fact 

- My name’s littlesquid, but I’m less 'tiny' and more 'will appear out of nowhere with snacks and random facts'.
